# Software_Sec

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was a financial consultant company offering guidance and advice to customers.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I was able to identify vulnerabilities in the code quickly as well as use tools that could expose vulnerabilities. Creating secure code is important to maintain the overall health of the program over a long lifespan.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
It was really helpful learning to use the vulnerability assessment tools because they can be applied to any project that uses libraries in it.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
It's important to keep on top of emerging vulnerabilities by constantly keeping up education on security.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To make sure code is secure after refactoring you need to run it through tests that it has passed through previously to ensure those test still pass.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The vulnerability assessment tool will be very helpful in looking at possible libraries in any projects I use in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would showcase the vulnerability assessment report because I think it shows good use and reflection on using a complicated tool.
